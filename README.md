üöÄ Project Showcase: Human Behavior Analysis Web App

I am excited to present my latest project, a Human Behavior Analysis Web App, developed using Python's Flask framework and powered by Firebase Realtime Database. This project aims to analyze human behavior based on input data and provide insightful predictions.

üìã Project Description:
The Human Behavior Analysis Web App offers a user-friendly interface where users can input behavioral data through a questionnaire. The questionnaire collects various textual responses related to personality traits, preferences, and other relevant information.

üî¨ Data Analysis:
Once the user submits the questionnaire, the app processes the data using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It applies a pre-trained machine learning ensemble model to analyze the text data, making predictions about the user's behavior based on the provided inputs.

üí° Key Features:

Questionnaire: Users can fill out a questionnaire with text-based responses.
Personality Analysis: Machine learning models analyze the text data to predict personality traits.
Real-Time Results: Predictions are displayed instantly on the web app.
Admin Dashboard: An admin page displays the collected data in a tabular form, facilitating easy analysis.
Data Management: Admins can delete data records from the Firebase Realtime Database.

Deployment with Ngrok:
The project leverages Ngrok for seamless deployment during development. Ngrok provides a secure tunnel to the locally hosted Flask app, enabling real-time access and feedback from colleagues and stakeholders. By integrating Ngrok into the development environment, the app becomes accessible via a dynamically generated Ngrok URL. This allows for easy sharing and presentation of the web app without the need for complicated server deployments.

üîç Technologies Used:
- Python (Flask): Backend development and server-side scripting.
- Firebase Realtime Database: Realtime data storage and retrieval.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzing textual data for behavior predictions.
- Bootstrap, HTML/CSS/JS
- ML Models for prediction used:
   Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree
- A final ensemble model used to make the accuracy higher.
- Validation of ML Models used

üìà Impact:
This Human Behavior Analysis Web App has significant potential across various domains, including market research, personality assessment, and customer behavior analysis. It can be tailored to meet specific business needs and provide valuable insights into user behaviors and preferences.

I am proud to have worked on this exciting project, and I look forward to exploring further applications and improvements in the field of behavior analysis and data-driven decision-making.
